# Course overview


## Course Syllabus

1. Data mining and ML - What kinds of problems ML can solve and how.

Types of problems

Classification – predict categories (spam vs not spam)

Clustering – group similar data (customer segmentation)

Association – find relationships (people who buy X also buy Y)

Prediction/Regression – predict numbers (sales, prices)


Processess:

Data preperation (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
Model building
Evaluation and tuning

Classical ML Techniques:

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Bayesian Networks

Evolutionary Algorithms

Intro Neural Networks



2. Deep learning and Neural Networks - Why deep learning started working well

Different neural network architectures

How neural networks are trained and deployed

How to fine tune pre trained models instead of training from scratch

Where deep learning is strongest (vision, text, multimedia, web)
